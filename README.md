Adds smaller versions of Endermen to Minecraft.

Small Endermen requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

## Installation

1. Install [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) if it is not installed.
2. Download Small Endermen from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/small-endermen/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Small-Endermen/releases).
3. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

This mod adds small and tiny endermen, which are rarer than normal endermen. Small endermen are two blocks tall, while tiny endermen are around 1.5 blocks tall. As a result, they can reach the same places that players can.
